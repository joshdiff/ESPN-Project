			<h2>How this page works</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Player information is initially loaded from a JSON file which would normally be retrieved by an AJAX request.</li>
				<li>Once the file is loaded, each entery is used to create a <strong>Player Object</strong>
				<li>The Player Object stores general information and all statistics for that particular Player</li>
				<li>The Player Object also currently has one fuction called <strong>showStats()</strong> which shows their stats in the right pane.
				<li>As each Player Object is created, it is saved into a local JavaScript array to call for display and future editing on the screen (editing coming in v2.0)</li>
				<li>Finally, all Player Objects are displayed on the left</li>
			</ul>
